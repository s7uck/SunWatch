<title>Fun Facts</title>

  <p>Above <strong>72° N</strong> and below <strong>72° S</strong>, during the summer the Sun never reaches 18° below the horizon. That means the sky is never really dark. The opposite is true in the winter, where the sky only gets bright enough to see the horizon throughout the day.</p>

  <p>On <strong>July 1, 2024</strong>, at <a href="/?lat=48.916945669&long=0&date=2024-07-01&time=02:05"><strong>48.916945669°N</strong></a>, the night lasts exactly 199 milliseconds.</p>

  <p>On <strong>December 1, 2024</strong>, at <a href="/?lat=68.977336&long=0&date=2024-12-01"><strong>68.977336°N</strong></a>, the day (when the Sun is at least partly above the horizon) lasts 22 seconds. That means you'll be able to see the Sun start rising and then setting right after in the span of ~20 seconds, without it ever fully rising above the horizon.</p>

  <p>The darkest time of the night, also the lowest elevation of the Sun, is called <strong>nadir</strong>. It usually occurs around 2 am during the summer and midnight during the winter.</p>

  <p>On the North and South poles, dawn and dusk occur once every 6 months. A <a href="/about">twilight phase</a> can last for a few days. For example, at 90°N in 2024, the Sun rises on <a href="/?lat=90&date=2024-03-21">March 21</a> (spring equinox) and sets on <a href="/?lat=90&date=2024-09-29">September 29</a> (fall equinox), and nautical twilight lasts from <a href="/?lat=90&date=2024-02-19">February 19</a> to <a href="/?lat=90&date=2024-03-06">March 6</a>.</p>

  <p>On July 8, at 11:15 UTC, 99% of humans on Earth see sunlight at the same time. This was confirmed by researchers at <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/news/astronomy/99-percent-sunlight-july-8">timeanddate.com</a> who calculated that on the first days of July, the Sun directly illuminates ~83% of people and another ~16% experiences some form of twilight. Only 1% of people on Earth will experience the night, mostly Australians. This works because most of Earth's landmasses are on one "side" of the Earth. The Pacific ocean would still be in darkness, as only one side of the Earth can be sunlit at once. This statistic is also affected by population densities. There are very big landmasses that aren't sunlit at all on this occurrence, but they aren't very densely populated and thus don't affect the statistic as much.</p>
