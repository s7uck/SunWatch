  <p>The terms 'sunrise' and 'sunset' refer to the exact moments that the Sun's disc fully emerges or descends into the horizon. However, even after the Sun is no longer visible, there is still enough daylight in the sky for about 25~30 minutes. This period of time is called twilight, and it occurs every morning before sunrise (dawn) and every night after sunset (dusk).</p>

  <p>Twilight is caused by the light from the Sun still being reflected in the atmosphere from below the horizon, and we can see this at higher altitudes. Higher up, the sun will appear earlier and disappear later, making the causes of twilight more apparent.</p>

  <p>Depending on the Sun's positon below the horizon, we can define 3 different 'stages' of twilight:</p>

    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>They occur in this order:</p>

  <ol class="vertical list">
    <li>Night.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Astronomical dawn</strong>. This is the first stage of dawn, and it occurs when the Sun is 18° below the horizon. Despite being very similar to night, the sky gets noticeably less dark and the fainter stars begin to disappear. After astronomical dawn, some astronomical observations can no longer be made. In some places like cities, with extreme light pollution, astronomical twilight is often indistinguishable from night. In very dark skies, the effect is very noticeable.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Nautical dawn</strong>. The sun reaches 12° below the horizon at this stage. The surroundings are still quite dark, but there is enough light in the sky for ships at sea to distinguish the horizon. During nautical twilight lighthouses typically remain on.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Civil dawn</strong>. At this point, the Sun is little more than 6° below the horizon. This time of day is very similar to daytime, with the exception that nothing is directly illuminated by the Sun. During this stage, artificial lights are no longer necessary for most outdoor activities.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Sunrise</strong>. The Sun rises above the horizon for the first time. By convention, after sunrise, the day officially starts.</li>
    
    <li>Noon.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Sunset</strong>. The Sun fully dips below the horizon.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Civil dusk</strong>. The Sun reaches 6° below the horizon. After civil dusk, artificial lights become necessary for the majority of activities. This time is often used to regulate when headlights should be switched on.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Nautical dusk</strong>. After the Sun reaches 12° below the horizon, it becomes difficult for sailors to distinguish the sky from the sea. Lighthouses are turned on before nautical twilight. People on the beach usually leave at this time.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Astronomical dusk</strong>. At this point, the Sun is 18° below the horizon. Observatories usually begin function at astronomical dusk. Beyond astronomical twilight it is technically, honestly, night.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Each 'stage' of twilight lasts approximately ~6 minutes near the Equator and upwards of days at the Arctic circles. From anywhere on Earth, the twilight period is shortest around the equinoxes and longest on the solstices.</p>
